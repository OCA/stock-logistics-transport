Manage partners stock depots.

Allow to define the transporter depot for that partner. When distributing parcels to customers, 
a transporter may bring the parcels to a local depot for then organizing a local distribution around the depot.
This base module only provides the depot model on the partner.

This module is the base module to define `Stock Depot` model. It should be extended to manage stock flows
