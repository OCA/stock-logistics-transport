This module extend the shipment advice planner engine to add a new planning
method based on geo-localization. It uses the GEOCONCEPT solution called
TourSolver to plan the shipment advices according to the location of the customers
by calculating the best route according to the available resources.

Configuration
=============

Before configuring this module, you must configure your account and your
resources on the TourSolver website. Then you should be able to get your api key
and paste it in the default backend. You can access to backends list under the
setting menu of the inventory module.

The second step is to create the resources. You can add the properties you want
TourSolver to use in its calculation of the best route.

For advanced planning, you can define your customer delivery windows. It will be
considered in TourSolver calculation.

For more details about the properties you can use, please consult
[TourSolver documentation](https://mygeoconcept.com/doc/6cc656Uv7gARvG6T/ts-cloud-doc/docs/en/toursolver-cloud-book/)

Usage
=====

In the shipment planner you will see a new option added to the planning methods.
If you select TourSolver, a TourSolver task per warehouse will be created for
the pickings you want to plan.

The task will pass through different states by a dedicated cron and at the end
of the process will create shipment advices according the returned result from
TourSolver.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

At this stage, the TourSolver task is managed by a cron which will synchronize
its status with TourSolver and get the result when it is ready.
Another approach is available using queue jobs where the sync task will be
rescheduled until it gets the optimization result.

Ideally, a webhook can be developed to be notified by toursolver when the result
is ready. He will ensure that the result is obtained as soon as possible.
