* Importation of scheduling from Maxoptra is not supported if the warehouse
  uses Outgoing Shipments in 3 steps.
* Column names in CSV generated on Maxoptra can differ from the columns used
  by the wizard. (e.g. Rescheduling of Delivery Operations is based on
  "Scheduled arrival time" which must be present in CSV)
